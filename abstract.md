<b>Abstract:</b>

In today's fast-growing world, farmers are facing issues of incompatible soil structure with the expected crop. There has been an enormous development in technology in the past few decades, but the account of innovation in the agricultural domain is still in its rudimentary phase. The farmers are often not aware of the quality (moisture level, pH level, water level, etc... ) of their land. 

So, using technology like the Internet of things, we will try to develop a versatile system to retrieve the parameter which affects the quality of soil and provide a responsive guide to measure the quality using those parameters. The real-time data will be provided on a mobile phone which will help farmers in deciding what to do next to prevent the deterioration of the quality of the crop.

By the above-proposed solution, the farmer can stay stress-free using this technology and manage the land just by a simple mobile application.
